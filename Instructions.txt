1. Containerize the Application
• Create a Dockerfile for a simple web app (e.g., Node.js or Python).
• Ensure the app exposes a port (e.g., 3000) for web access.

2. Launch EC2 Instance on AWS
• Create an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2.
• Install Docker and configure it to start on boot.

3. Configure GitHub Secrets
• Store EC2 IP, SSH Username, and SSH Key as GitHub Secrets.
• Use Base64 encoding for the private SSH key.

4. Build and Push Docker Image
• Build the Docker image locally.
• Push the image to DockerHub or Amazon ECR.

5. Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow
• Trigger the workflow on push to the main branch.
• Build and push the Docker image to the registry.

6. Deploy to EC2
• SSH into the EC2 instance using GitHub Actions.
• Pull the latest Docker image.
• Stop and remove any existing container.
• Run the new container, exposing the necessary port.

7. Test the Deployment
• Access the application using the public IP of the EC2 instance.
• Confirm that the latest version is running.
